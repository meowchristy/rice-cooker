               "Desiccant Potion": "A kind of potion that boosts Hydro RES and makes one able to withstand highly humid environments. \nIt is said to act like a desiccant and be highly effective at keeping items dry. It can also be ingested for the same effect.",
               "Frostshield Potion": "A miraculous potion that boosts Cryo RES and makes one able to withstand extreme cold. \nInduces a chilling sensation when drank, but once this sensation spreads throughout the body, the feeling of being cold disappears.",

bm = {"Hurricane Seed": "The imploded form of an Anemo Hypostasis upon its defeat. It contains the essence of Anemo energy.\nIt is said that the power to create hurricanes resides within its seemingly fragile body. This butterfly of pure Anemo energy must be waiting for the day to conjure up storms once again.",
     "Lightning Prism": "An Electro Hypostasis channels nearby elemental energy to repair damaged elemental entities. Contains the essence of Electro energy.\nA common prism separates white light into component colors; a Lightning Prism, however, channels flowing energy and weaves them into lightning. It will continue to do so even after the Electro Hypostasis has been defeated.",
     "Basalt Pillar": "A pillar formed by the shell of a Geo Hypostasis, composed of high-density Geo energy. It is a testament to Geo's status as the heaviest of the elements. Maybe the reason a Geo Hypostasis creates this pillar out of its shell and raises itself is just to get closer to the sky, not to combat enemies.",
     "Hoarfrost Core": "The exposed core of a defeated Cryo Regisvine. Pure Cryo elements are contained within it. Energy and thoughts that swell deep within the earth will eventually erupt on the surface. Even the deathly silent frost will attach to living things on the ground, turning even ordinary vegetation like vines into huge, vicious predators.",
     "Everflame Seed": "A seed that fuels the unending flames of the Pyro Regisvine. It emits Pyro energy as if it will burn all that has ever sprouted from the ground.\nEndless desires flow among turbulent energy deep within the earth. What desire could steadily hold such fire to the plants and long so eagerly to bathe everything in unquenchable flames?",
     "Cleansing Heart": "A palmful of eternal water left by an oceanid.\nThough it has already diffused among the depths of the lake, its purity remains all the same. But why would a creature so pure and clean as an oceanid covet the appearance of a being that roams the land, and assume such a form with pure water? They need not breathe nor do they require sustenance...",
     "Juvenile Jade": "A crystalline substance taken from a Primo Geovishap. Within it is contained the potential to become a dragon.\nThese dull crystals are precipitated within the bodies of vishaps sleeping in the mountains. Liyue folklore holds that they will gather power over many years, after which this crystal will, at last, replace their original heart, and the vishap will become a true dragon — one that can shake the mountains and split the earth.",
     "Crystalline Bloom": "An ice crystal of exceeding purity that is created in the frigid blooming of a Cryo Hypostasis.\nThese frosty crystals will continue to grow according to their own cold, rigid laws, till one day a flower of winter shall bloom and freeze everything. Perhaps it is stagnant time, that never-thawing bosom, that is the essence of this undying flower.",
     "Marionette Core": "This core can power the inorganic Maguu Kenki and cause it to wield a blade like a living being.\nFlesh decays, and with it decay all martial arts mastery and all poignant memories.\nPerhaps only by converting one's four limbs and body into sturdy mechanical parts, and by at last sacrificing one's very own heart for a sophisticated mechanical one, can one transcend the impermanence of the fleshly form...",
     "Perpetual Heart": "The core that powers the autonomous movements of the Perpetual Mechanical Array.\nSome theorize that the symbols on these cores have knowledge and logic inscribed upon them in a language that eyes cannot perceive. Some go a step further and believe that these unique Ruin machines autonomously decided to forsake a biomimetic form to pursue strength of function on account of their especially large cores and complex inscriptions.",
     "Smoldering Pearl": "A crystallization of a Pyro Hypostasis that constantly emits heat.\nEven the burning flames shall one day grow cold, and even the ashen firewood can will itself back into a raging blaze. It must then be the will of the world that Pyro Hypostases should constantly cool down and heat up, much like the universe teems with endless life... until the fated darkness shall one day descend and bring it all to naught.",
     "Dew of Repudiation": "A strange water droplet left behind by the collapse of the Hydro Hypostasis.\nIt has strong rejection properties, and this forms the basis of one of the Hydro Hypostasis' attack patterns as well. They say that water contains memories and willpower, and that these things can grow when bodies of water meld together. However, the waves conjured by the Hydro Hypostasis are incompatible with the currents that flow above and below ground. Even if it were to flow into the surpassingly pure waters of Petrichor, this drop of water will likely resist assimilation as strongly as mercury.",
     "Storm Beads": "Crackling Electro pearls left behind by the Thunder Manifestation.\nIt is said that Thunder Manifestations will only descend upon lands where powerful hatred dwells. The singers say that it is the unbearable disappointments and sufferings of life that drive them to forever wander the broken earth, unleashing sky-searing lightning as they go.",
     "Riftborn Regalia": "A broken horn that you obtained from defeating the Wolflord. That said, it should not have left anything behind after your hunt.\nEven a lord among the Riftwolves is nothing before monsters of a higher pedigree.\n\"Gold\" mass-produced these malformed wolf packs almost as if by accident, like shrunken drawings on discarded sheets of paper, and the horns on this one represent its authority to command its dark brood to dissolve space itself.",
     "Dragonheir's False Fin": "A piece of biological tissue that you found after defeating the Bathysmal Vishaps.\nAlthough it looks like a fin of some kind, it does not actually have any function at all\nThe people of Byakuyakoku once investigated the Bathysmal Vishaps quite deeply. Their most distinctive feature was the ability to choose what traits it wished to pass on to its offspring. Because of their great hatred for humanity, these vishaps will lose any visual acuity by the time they reach maturity. At the same time, they have evolved a certain degree of elemental polymorphism for combat purposes.",
     "Runic Fang": "A \"fang\" with which the mysterious, snakelike machine of old dug into mountains' depths. There are many ominous runes carved on it.\nIt is said that giant serpents lurk in the dark fissures deep beneath the ground. Burning with eternal resentment and malice toward the world above, they throw themselves into digging great tunnels, yet none know what their malicious purposes are…",
     "Majestic Hooked Beak": "An elongated bill that you found after defeating the Jadeplume Terrorshroom.\nResearchers still consider it a miracle even now that some soft Fungi have evolved these rock-hard hooked beaks. This magnificent king amongst Fungi has been leisurely pacing on the finish line of evolution. Now and then, it emits a long call to all the living beings in the rainforest: Even the most helpless and timid creature may one day become the monarch of the woods.",
     "Thunderclap Fruitcore": "The core of an Electro Regisvine, wrapped in razor-sharp leaves, wantonly emits Electro energy.\nThe roaring energy rampaging deep within the earth is eager to pour out its rage, thus even tainting these unfortunate vines with its mania, causing them to wail and flail their branches frantically. One can hardly tell whether it longs for others to taste the pain of being continuosly electrocuted and charred or if it is struggling, looking forward to its inevitable doom.",
     "Perpetual Caliber": "A motive device obtained from a mysterious ruin machine.\nThe machine it once powered may have been destroyed, but it continues to rotate all the same.\nThere should be no such thing as an energy source that can sustain itself forever in this world, and most research results obtained in the field of \"perpetual motion\" have been eventually proved false. Yet, this device is proof that a now-destroyed civilization once reached heights that present-day nations could not hope to match...",
     "Light Guiding Tetrahedron": "A core component obtained via defeating a mysterious ruin machine.\nTo this day, these ancient devices have not forgotten the dreams of their masters or their own duties: to build a thousand palaces, to administrate three thousand machines, to sow ten thousand flowers that shall never bloom again, and to recreate a paradise now buried beneath the desert sands for the sake of all who live in this world.\nThough the lord of the desert no longer lives, and those dreams have long been corrupted by sinful whispers, and though all the magical pillars have been broken and have collapsed, the great beast once favored by the king hides still within the great searing storm.",
     "Quelled Creeper": "The final coalesced form of the Dendro Hypostasis. The tough vines protect a pure cubic elemental crystal.\nDendro defies any common logic yet exists in perfect harmony with life. Elemental Hypostases, on the contrary, are most distant in appearance to all living beings. The combination of these two should probably never have appeared in this world. It is said that such elemental hypostases have the intelligence to \"learn\" and have thus understood the colors and dreams of the forest, a process that has transformed them into this shape over thousands of years.",
     "Psuedo-Stamens": "The pale wing-sheathes hiding in a Wenut's tail are as thin as the blooming stamens of a flower.\nIt is said that in the past, even before the beginning of time, they used to travel through the moist land under meadows and forests, similar to birds flying across the sky and fish swimming in the water. It is generally believed that their mimicry of flowers is to lure lost prey caught by sandstorms. There is also a theory, however, that their imitation of a blooming flower was inspired by the splendid blossoms countless epochs ago, which have long gone the way of the desert winds.",
     "Evergloom Ring": "A mystical weapon obtained after defeating the Four-Armed Envoy of dark tidings.\nRings are shaped like passageways, which is why arcane formations that are meant to produce some mystical effect are often ring-shaped. Such rings are perhaps gateways intended to guide the universe itself.",
     "Artificed Spare Clockwork Component — Coppelia": "An artificed spare clockwork component belonging to Coppelia. It powers this artificed dancer.\nAccording to its creator's design, the story of the artificed dancer with delicate joints ends at a merry moment. Coppelia will send whoever attempts to disturb that moment to a chapter of misfortune with her superb combat skills.",
     "Artificed Spare Clockwork Component — Coppelius": "An artificed spare clockwork component belonging to Coppelius. It powers this artificed dancer.\nThe artificed dancer whirls to a platinum tune, performing an unending waltz of icewind. Coppelius's dance will not stop. He will continue whirling till the bell tolls.",
     "Emperor's Resolution": "The war hammer of the Emperor of Fire and Iron. The mighty crab has crushed countless foes with this giant claw. Be it clockwork meka, other Fontemer Aberrants, or hunters with ill-placed curiosity — all have yielded under its power.\nFontemer Aberrants are different from human beings in that the concepts of aristocracy or inheritance are entirely foreign to them. None of them are born superior. One that survives deadly predators and adversities is able to accumulate infinite power as it keeps hunting and feeding over centuries. Such a creature is often referred to as an overlord for the fear it inspires."}

Nor is the mirror a means to shut out the looks of judgment from onlooking people, but is rather a bulwark against this base and sullied world. Within this great temple shall punishment be meted out and ignorance be cleansed.\nDreams shall be overturned, desires shall be cut away, and karma shall be reset.",
            "Daka's Bell": "This ball joint, used to connect mechanical limbs together, is shaped almost like a bell. Though it may seem dainty, it can be used to carry an unimaginably large amount of energy.\nIf connected to one's arms, then one will lose all feeling in them.\nAnd all strength in one's legs will dissipate if such joints are connected to them.\nConnect this joint to one's skull...\nAh, hatred, pain, madness, pride — none of these will be washed away.\nMost fortunate.",
            "Worldspan Fern": "A fern taken from the oasis within Apep's body.\nAt the dawn of time, the world belonged to the dragons. There, the ferns were the first to sprout in the lush verdant world of Apep's court.\nIn the ages after, these ferns would become trees, vines, roots, and leaves, blanketing the world with their touch. But Apep still remembers the first frond as it stretched freely toward the sky, making a sound so delicate as to go unheard.",
            "Primordial Greenbloom": "A primordial flower procured from the oasis within Apep.\nWith the passing of eons, flowers grew in fragrance and volume, and they gained a collection of titles as numerous as the stars in the night sky.\nHowever, this first flower to bloom never bore any name. For the dragons of old, even if a rose lost its name, it would not lose its scent. Naming things is but how lesser, ephemeral beings understand the world. Life is not constrained by words, and will always grow and evolve.",
            "Everamber": "A piece of amber taken from the oasis within Apep. Inside the amber, a small, long-extinct insect remains frozen in time.\nTo the tree, it was circumstance that led this little life to be wreathed within its amber. But for said life, this was fate.\nFollowing the heaven-sent disaster, wood, vines, roots, and all manner of flora withered and turned to dust. A great many life forms disappeared.\nBut in the stillness of amber, a nameless insect endures in this otherworldly oasis, reaching a future that no others of its kind could."}

wa_desc = {"Tile of Decarabian's Tower": "The place now known as Stormterror's Lair was once the capital city of Decarabian, the God of Storms. Since this dream of prosperity was created entirely by his divine might, the broken pieces left behind by the shattering of that dream still possess great power.",
           "Debris of Decarabian's City": "Decarabian, the God of Storms, was content with the capital city he had raised, and accepted the worship of the people from atop his tower. But he knew not that the people did not bow to him out of respect or adoration.",
           "Fragment of Decarabian's Epic": "Andrius once declared war upon Decarabian, but failed to even scratch the capital of the Lord of the Tower. If it were not for the song of freedom that shattered the city in an instant, Decarabian's dream would have gone on forever.",
           "Scattered Piece of Decarabian's Dream": "The people did not bow to Decarabian out of respect or adoration, but because the harsh winds had laid them low. This was the shattered dream and ambition of the Anemo Archon[Note 1] before the rise of Barbatos.\nHe tried so hard to make his dream come true, and so the fragments of that dream are still mighty.",
           "Boreal Wolf's Milk Tooth": "Andrius' wolf pack is its blessed honor guard, and even the milk teeth of a wolf cub possess great potential.\nIn the past, the gods had the responsibility to love all people. Andrius was therefore quite unusual in that he became leader of the wolves, while only welcoming abandoned babies and wanderers when it came to humans.",
           "Boreal Wolf's Cracked Tooth": "The life of a wolf is not without violence; broken bones or cracked teeth are nothing special.\nAndrius found humans to be a disappointment, but believed babies to be innocent. If both the wolf pack and the adopted children chose each other, then they become a Lupical, a fated family.",
           "Boreal Wolf's Broken Fang": "The wolf pack also understands that humans are not solitary creatures. The honorary broken tooth is a parting gift said to bring protection and luck.\nIn the legends of a far-off world, a female wolf once adopted two great humans. Their home was known as the Cave of Wolves, or Lupercal - [sic] that word meaning the same thing as Lupical does in this world.",
           "Boreal Wolf's Nostalgia": "The Wolf King, believing himself to despise humans, thought himself unable to envision a happy life for humanity, making him unworthy of becoming the Lord of the Winds of the world. Therefore, he chose to disappear. Yet, in truth, he gazes on the ones abandoned by the world ever so gently.",
           "Fetters of the Dandelion Gladiator": "It's a human thing to exaggerate a hero's story, even to the point of elevating the fetters that once bound the hero to the level of an enemy of true freedom.\nAs a result, these fetters were granted extraordinary powers.",
           "Chains of the Dandelion Gladiator": "The chains that once bound the great hero Vennessa. In truth, all gladiators would have worn chains in that era, and Vennessa was but one of many.",
           "Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator": "Vennessa was not truly bound by her chains. If she had so wished, no ordinary physical constraints forged in Mondstadt could have held her, for the land there yielded no ore of exceptional quality, nor did it possess the divine flame of her ancestral home.\nShe was only bound by her responsibility to take care of her tribespeople.",
           "Dream of the Dandelion Gladiator": "Vennessa may have been freed from slavery, but she then found herself subject to many other, even greater forms of bondage. What began as a duty to her tribespeople extended to all of Mondstadt, then to the concept of freedom itself, and beyond a point even to the whole world.\nWhat she really hoped for, in truth, was that the world might grow stronger.",
           "Luminous Sands from Guyun": "The stone pillars that tower amid Guyun Stone Forest were once the stone spears Morax used to defeat his enemies. Over time, the gods' substance has seeped into the pillars that pin them down, lending them divine power. The pillars sometimes shed fragments of hatred and curses.",
           "Lustrous Stone from Guyun": "The learned know that Guyun Stone Forest is far more than simply a miraculous sight on the sea to behold: It is the cemetery of the former gods of Liyue. Hatred and filth have periodically risen up from it, but all have been subdued by a demon-conquering young man.",
           "Relic from Guyun": "The stone spear has a glimmering core formed by the power of the defeated gods. Their hatred is not directed at Morax, however, for they have lost themselves a long time ago and are incapable of holding personal grudges.",
           "Divine Body from Guyun": "That which lurks within and animates this relic are the divine remains of lamenting gods. They are unrealized ideals, designs for a prosperous humanity that could never be. They may now lie deep within stone and sea, but they will not go quietly into the night.",
           "Mist Veiled Lead Elixir": "Jueyun Karst is the realm of the mighty and illuminated adepti. But other than the ability to control the elements of the world, Jueyun Karst is also home to three other untold secrets: Alchemy, Sigils, and Sub-Space Creation.",
           "Mist Veiled Mercury Elixir": "With Fulu (Sigils), the adepti can store their power in the form of symbols, and with Waijing (Sub-Space Creation) they can fashion a cosmic paradise with the power of their minds. The manufacture of elixirs, however, has always been shrouded in mystery, for certain death follows for any who swallow them.",
           "Mist Veiled Gold Elixir": "Elixirs are in fact pills made from metal alloys. They were created by the adepti, and are able to grant weapons transcendent powers. However, they are rarely seen in the world due to the hubris of the practitioners of martial arts, who prized the ways of combat over the paths of the adepti.",
           "Mist Veiled Primo Elixir": "An elixir of the highest quality. It embodies a state of intertwining order and chaos, and is said to mirror how the world was when it was first created. Of course, a certain someone knows that this was not the case.",
           "Grain of Aerosiderite": "A black meteor once fell beyond Liyue's Sea of Clouds, said to have fallen to vanquish a monster. However, it was stained by powerful tainted blood, so this item no longer possesses the pure power of Rex Lapis.",
           "Piece of Aerosiderite": "Rumors of sea monsters are commonplace in Liyue, since the other shore is an unknown region that lies outside of Teyvat. Without the protection of The Seven, all that lies beyond is unknown chaos. Only power beyond the order of Teyvat is able to stain the power of Rex Lapis black.",
           "Bit of Aerosiderite": "The coastal nations of Teyvat refer to the region beyond the protection of The Seven as the Dark Sea. It is said that many defeated gods refused to live under the new order of The Seven, so they fled to remote islands and became evil gods. However, their powers came from the same source as Rex Lapis, separate from this all-devouring darkness.",
           "Chunk of Aerosiderite": "When Khaenri'ah was destroyed, a great sinner created endless monsters with dark, alien blood flowing through their veins. They rampaged across the land, destroying all in their paths. They were mutated lifeforms, and the mutations were caused by powers from beyond this world. The black serpentine dragon Durin that attacked Mondstadt was one such mutated being.",
           "Coral Branch of a Distant Sea": "Watatsumi Island is the furthest from Narukami Island in the Inazuman island chain, and its name means \"the god of the oceans\" in the island's ancient tongue. Legend has it that when the great serpent first arose within the abyssal nation of ever-night, its fluorescent body was covered in myriad-colored coral.",
           "Jeweled Branch of a Distant Sea": "This coral cannot be found anywhere in Teyvat, but was a gift that the great serpent obtained when it broke into the Dark Sea. For that abyssal snake, to be filled with coral was to be mighty, and its power would be shaved away as those corals were lost. In other words, those corals contain power far beyond the norm.",
           "Jade Branch of a Distant Sea": "Fleeing into the Dark Sea, the god that had lost everything met the abandoned people who had nothing within the ocean depths. Thus it elected to remain and become their \"Orobashi no Mikoto,\" their \"Watatsumi Omikami.\"\nIt is said that the great snake god once broke off all the coral branches on its body to give light to the children who were curled up in the darkness. They also say that it used these coral branches to create a huge ladder to allow those children to once again reach the surface and see the light of day.",
           "Golden Branch of a Distant Sea": "The meaning that lies behind the name \"Watatsumi\" is simply the unrequited hopes that the abandoned people who dwelt in the deep sea pinned upon the serpent god that led them.\nAnd it was also because the serpent god now had people who worshiped it that it stayed in the world it should have long fled, breaking off the coral branches that adorned its body, treading upon land where it should not have, and facing a foe it could never hope to match — till at last, its divine form was sundered along with the mountains, its ichor turned into plasma, and its will and power became a curse that could never be extinguished: Tatarigami.",
           "Narukami's Wisdom": "In the past, the ancients would climb the peak now known as Mt. Yougou and bend wood that had been charred by lightning into a hook to offer as an effigy unto the thundering force that lit up the skies and shook the earth. This shape would eventually become the \"Electro Mitsudomoe\" symbol, symbolizing the favor, wisdom, and might of Electro, and also the people who represent these values.",
           "Narukami's Joy": "Those who belong to the Shogunate Commissions are those who administer and exercise power. In the monster-filled tales of the ancient past, those who were deeply trusted by the Shogun would bear talismans with this hooked design on their person, and just as the word \"commission\" means to \"joyfully serve\" in the old tongue, those who received her favor would return it with love and loyalty. Yet, after a certain point in time, nothing would be as it was before.",
           "Narukami's Affection": "All demons who wander in the wilderness or live amongst mortals will be attracted by the sight of the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, represented by the Electro Mitsudomoe. Though their lives may be longer than any creature, they will at last come to their end. If those with limited lifespans hanker after eternity, then they can only pray that \"Eternity\" remembers them. And she did indeed answer their prayers, remembering them all, friend and foe alike, in her heart. No matter whether it was the demon owls who resided amidst the fog and ripped through the skies, the bake-danuki who dared to trespass her imperial gardens, or that female oni, lovely as the moon and mighty in battle, yet who would eventually come to blows with her... Whether it was the tengu who soared on dark wings or the Kitsune Saiguu who once walked by her side, but who eventually disappeared forever...\nThese countless tales have come to rest within her heart, and someday, they will surely shine again in the eternal paradise of her dreams.",
           "Narukami's Valor": "The treasure of the lord of thunder is her majesty, and that majesty is embodied in her valor and wrath. Her wrath comes from the love that persists in her heart, and her valor supports that anger. Thus, whomsoever should block the path towards eternity or lay a finger on Inazuma's people shall become her foe.\nThey say that there were four great spirits, three divine foxes, and two great swords — but that the symbol of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, could only be a single strike, unsurpassed and brilliant as a meteor.",
           "Mask of the Wicked Lieutenant": "Folktales tell that once upon a time, there lived an oni named Torachiyo. Torachiyo was a highly skilled warrior, such that it was once said the Torachiyo might dance amid a thousand blades, juunihitoe robes becoming shredded like falling violet petals, and yet not receive a single wound. Yet this oni would eventually betray the Shogun and revolt, becoming shorn of an arm and a horn in the battle before fleeing and slaying itself in a fit of furious madness.\nHearsay holds that the stubborn oni often hold fear and distress in their hearts. That they should fantasize about eternity yet fear the moment, and are apt to become swallowed by terror or anger is their just reward. This mask depicts Torachiyo, fangs bared.",
           "Mask of the Tiger's Bite": "\"Sumirezome Sangetsu Kogetsukan\" depicts the fierce oni Torachiyo shattering the Shogun's naginata with a single bite, thus gaining the upper hand for a time. As such, masks that are based on him have finely crafted fangs.\nIn the denouement of this tale, the wounded oni fled into the forest, deathly afraid of showing himself even to the cold moonlight. The wind that whispers through the alleys and valleys can be said to resemble his quiet cries of agony, and so there is a poetic seasonal expression for this in Inazuma: \"Torachiyo's Wind.\"",
           "Mask of the One-Horned": "In the lost songs of the oni nursemaids, Torachiyo was an elegant young man, strong of body and fair of face. He was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones, winning renown for the oni, whose blood thinned with each passing day.\nNone now sing these songs, but the mask of a horned oni, even in a different form, still possesses power beyond the norm.",
           "Mask of the Kijin": "Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.\nThis is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"\nBut within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.\nFew among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.",
           "Copper Talisman of the Forest Dew": "Under the instructions of the First Sage, the ancestors of the forest people made these talismans using withered trees to commemorate the Lord of Verdure.\nThe talisman's shape was inspired by the forest dew. It symbolizes the permeation of wisdom into mortal minds.",
           "Iron Talisman of the Forest Dew": "Later, the Lord of Verdure taught people the mystery of the forging of black iron. The innocent mortals thus grasped the knowledge of using fire to forge blades.\nThe Lord of Verdure took pleasure in their knowledge — Lethal as fire and blades were to her, they made ordinary people powerful.",
           "Silver Talisman of the Forest Dew": "In the myriad lore of the forest, the one in the striped cape that resembled blazing flames was the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and the Owner of the Moon-Mirrored Spring.\nWhen he bowed his head and struck up a friendship with the Lord of Verdure, the tokens of their friendship were the gems that glimmered like water and silver that gleamed like the moonlight.\nTo repay such a gesture, the Lord of Verdure promised to keep secrets for the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and safeguard the intricate and beautiful dreams of the rainforest.\nNo one could have foretold that the magnificent mansion of secrets and dreams would later fade away amidst the shroud of the dark flame of oblivion, after which its ash returned to the soil and became nutrients for the virgin rainforests.",
           "Golden Talisman of the Forest Dew": "\"Mortals hold dear three things only: the spring water that embraces the moonlight, verdant life, and ageless youth...\"\nThe nature of \"wisdom\" is not domination over all minds or scheming to gain all the benefit. Instead, it is about empowering even ordinary beings to one day overcome their imposed constraints.\nThough the roar of the tiger is no longer heard in the forest and the resilient guardians would seclude themselves within the dreams of children... On the night when every secret golden seal is lifted and all dreams glow like amber in the moonlight, perhaps she and her beloved people will eventually win genuine freedom.",
           "Oasis Garden's Reminiscence": "People used to say that the Lord of Flowers was the Lord of Joy and Happiness. Freshwater sprang from her sleeves, and thus was the oasis of blossoming flowers born in the desert. Flowers and grasses followed in her footsteps, and gleaming moonlight cleared the way for her.\nIn the bitter days when the sky turned its back on the ground, the Lord of Flowers extended her mercy to each and every one of the mortals, letting them regain their happiness and egos, allowing leisure and luxury to resume.",
           "Oasis Garden's Kindness": "In the literature buried deep beneath the yellow sands, the Lord of Flowers was the Mistress of Dreams.\nShe bestowed dreams upon the exiled, the manic, and the foolish. In those dreams, they were presented with their dearest delights. Burdened by the brutality of reality, they were fascinated by the charm of the Lord of Flowers and captivated by her beauty and care.",
           "Oasis Garden's Mourning": "The Lord of Flowers was in an amicable relationship with the Jinn.\nThe Mistress of Flowers and Oases joined hands with the Lord of Deserts and built Ay-Khanoum, the \"City of Amphitheaters,\" which carried the meaning of \"City of the Moon Maiden\" in the ancient language of the Jinn.\nLater, however, it was said that the Lord of Flowers died due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand, after which the blossoms of purple Padisarahs were never seen again in the oases.\nAfter the departure of the Lord of Flowers, the sandstorms keened, the Jinn sobbed, and the moonlight-silver gem disc lost its original, glad purpose, giving off a mournful glimmer.",
           "Oasis Garden's Truth": "\"Who would worship a departed god?\"\nThe Lord of Flowers was once in alliance with two other gods. Apart from wisdom and power, she also brought mercy and joy to her people.\nJust as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and pouring rain, to the people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and love, singing and music, and wine and extravagance were just as vital as strength and sensibility.\nIt is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a spectacular death, and that death was precisely the wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers — for death adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time across endless memories.\nThe ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her reasoning. He only reveled in her immense charm and grace — and as misguided as such fervent affections might be, they were well within the calculations of the Lord of Flowers.",
           "Echo of Scorching Might": "A long time ago, the people of the Lord of Deserts carved these imperial insignias based on robust beetles to memorialize the bright sun that marked the shifting of day and night, as well as the infinity of such times.\nThough the name of that Lord is no longer mentioned, these imperial insignias have been preserved through time, each bearing a faint ambiance of those past glories.\nThese insignias travel with the descendants of the Eremite Tribe, silently telling the tales of their then-Lord.",
           "Remnant Glow of Scorching Might": "To weave together myriad thoughts and reign over countless souls — this is the essence of power.\nHowever, power is not cold-blooded tyranny. Its true ideal, at its heart, is to create a utopia free of worry, schemes, and slavery.\nIt was just as the silent lord saw in the crystal's secrets, and just as the lost companion had once taught.\nThe dark insect insignia and the steel judgment thus laid the foundations of the kingdom's rules.",
           "Dream of Scorching Might": "Silver moonlight and clear springs once completed the scenery of the oases. But as the Lord of Flowers faded in the darkening sandstorm, so was the worriless golden paradise submerged by death.\nIn the poetry of the Eremite Tribe, the moon cast its silver light on the crimson mantle, causing Al-Ahmar, the Mourning King, to be driven to madness.\nIn a melancholic desert ballad, driven by the haunting nostalgia, the lonely king created an ever-youthful dreamland in the center of the desert, where undisturbed water sprang up and perpetual dusk remained.",
           "Olden Days of Scorching Might": "In the era when the ignorant Lord of Deserts ruled, his power descended upon every inch of the land like the scorching sun.\nAncient stone tablets record that he turned his power into seven rays of blinding light or seven pillars, which he granted equally and mercifully to everyone. No one was neglected, nor was anyone discontented.\nThat was a forgotten golden era, an era when the Lord of Flowers had faded into the sands and the Lord of Verdure was determined to leave. Only the descendants in the yellow sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone brightly like amber and gold.\nYet calamity befell nonetheless, and the golden insectoid insignias were buried beneath the depths of shrine and palace, under collapsed pillars engraved with images of eagles and bulls."
